I am planning to first write a function to calculate the prefix notation expression.
I will worry about handling input, history, and other features later.

I am going to implement the history feature next, so the prefix notation calculator function
can refer back to prior results if needed.

I also installed a Racket library to format the source code nicely.
Command: raco fmt -i <filename>.rkt
